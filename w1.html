					<h2>Learning How to Use OnShape and Laser Cutting!</h2>
					<div class="col-md-12 animate-box">
						
						<p>During our first week of Digital Fabrication, we have learned all about press-fit construction, using the laser cutter, and how to use online designing programs, such as OnShape and Fusion360. All of the tutorials this week were based in Fusion360, however, my computer is too run to old this program, so I reverted to OnShape. OnShape is a free cloud-based designing service that has the same applications as Fusion, just in a simplier layout (in my opinion). </p>

						<p>One important part of this week was becoming familiar with the OnShape interface, such as how to use variables/parameters to change the dimsensions of a given sketch. </p>

						<p>After following many tutorials online, and practicing with simple shapes, I finally decided it was time to create my project. For this week, we are tasked to create press-fit shapes. A press-fit object is designed with ridges on the sides that fit together when pressed together, and therefore can hold a solid shape without any glue or tape. </p>

						</div>
						<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 cp-l text-left animate-box">
							<p>After designing all of my shapes, it was time to cut these pieces out using a laser cutter. Before cutting, we all recieved a demonstration on how to use this cutter, making sure all of the cardboard pieces were in place and out of danger. </p>

							<p>This box, like many of the upcoming project this semester, is going to be created out of cardboard so it was important to include the height of the cardboard when telling the laser how deep to cut. </p>

						<div class="col-lg-6 col-lg-pull-6 col-md-12 col-md-pull-0 cp-r text-left animate-box">
							<p>When I got through my third cut, I realized that all of my pieces were finally the way I wanted them to look and I decided to begin assembling. I put all of my six individual pieces together to form my box.</p>

							<p>The "kerf" measurements was one of the biggest issues with this project because it made the size of the box sides change a little bit depending on how much extra the machine cut off. Once I figured out how to measure the kerf and account for it in my project, the whole project got a lot easier. The kerf was definetly one of the biggest learning curves of this entire project, but in the end I am glad that we had to learn how to get around these small challenges.</p>

							<p>This is my final box after putting all of the press-fit pieces together! After asembling this box, I realized why the dimensions are so important when designing press-fit objects! With one small mistake, my pieces could have not fit together, and I would have had to completely restart all of my progress for this week! </p>

							<p>Overall, even though we completed a simple project, this week was very beneficial in learning the foundations of online CAD designing, even if I had to do mine in OnShape. I know these skills will come in handy as the projects get more advanced, so it was nice to start out by just making a simple box to learn the basics!</p>

							<h2>Learning How to Use GibHub to Create This Website!</h2>
							<p>Another really important skill I learned this week was how to use GitHub, the platform you are viewing this website on now! Before starting this class, I had never used GitHub, or even had heard of a Repository! I have had some background experience using Python and C++ in different coding classes in my high school, but nothing to this level. It was actually fairly simple to create this page, once I created the Repository through GitHub and learned to publish/change my edits through GitHub Desktop, right on my Mac. All of the files we are working with are also local on my Mac, which makes it really eays to go in and edit my classwork/homework logs to update all of my progress while I am following the lesson plans in class. </p>
	
							<p>Coming into this program, I knew the basics of HTML from projects done throughout my high school career. This definetly gave me a good foundation to create this website, as it is all based off of HTML and CSS templates. </p>
	
							<p>Stay tuned every week as I update these pages, creating a portfolio for my progress throughout this class! See you next week! </p>
